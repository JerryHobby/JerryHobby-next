# Programming Languages

There are many programming languages. They pretty much all do the same thing,
but they have different syntax. Each languange promises to solve a different
problem, but they all solve the same problem.

The biggest differentiator
between language is not the language itself, but the libraries that are
available for that language. The libraries are what make the language useful.

Apple likes to say that Swift is the fastest growing programming language. Google
promotes Go as the fastest growing programming language. Android developers use
Java and Kotlin. Web developers use JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, and C#.

All languages perform the same basic operations. They all have variables, loops,
conditionals, functions, and classes. They all have the same basic data types:
numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects. They all have the same basic
operators: +, -, *, /, %, =, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, !, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.

Choosing a language to learn is more about choosing what platform you want to code
for and what libraries you want to use. If you want to code for iOS, you'll need
to learn Swift. If you want to code for Android, you'll need to learn Java or
Kotlin. If you want to code for the web, you'll need to learn JavaScript, Python,
Ruby, PHP, or C#. If you want to code for Windows, you'll need to learn C#.

Just for fun, here's the list of string variable definitions in various programming languages.
They all do the same thing, but they all look different due to the syntax of the language:

1. **Python:**
   ```python
   myString = "Hello World"
   ```

2. **JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   var myString = "Hello World";
   ```

3. **Java:**
   ```java
   String myString = "Hello World";
   ```

4. **C#:**
   ```csharp
   string myString = "Hello World";
   ```

5. **C++:**
   ```cpp
   std::string myString = "Hello World";
   ```

6. **Ruby:**
   ```ruby
   myString = "Hello World"
   ```

7. **PHP:**
   ```php
   $myString = "Hello World";
   ```

8. **Swift:**
   ```swift
   var myString = "Hello World"
   ```

9. **Kotlin:**
   ```kotlin
   val myString = "Hello World"
   ```

10. **Go:**
    ```go
    var myString string = "Hello World"
    ```

11. **Rust:**
    ```rust
    let myString = "Hello World";
    ```

12. **TypeScript:**
    ```typescript
    let myString: string = "Hello World";
    ```
