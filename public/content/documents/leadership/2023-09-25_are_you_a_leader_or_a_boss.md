# Are you a Leader or a Boss?

Management styles vary depending on the company culture, the leadership personalities, and the nature
of the work. Some companies are very hierarchical and have a very top-down management style. Other
companies are very flat and have a very collaborative management style.

When it comes to managing a team, there are two main styles: leadership and bossing. Both styles
have their place, but one is more effective than the other. The question is, which one are you?

## What is a leader?

A leader is someone who inspires others and gives them the tools they need to succeed. A leader
recognizes that their team needs to be motivated and empowered to do their best work.

## What is a boss?

A boss is someone who tells others what to do and expects them to do it. Expectations are set and
the boss expects the team to meet them. A boss motivates their team through the threat of disciplinary
action.

## What is the difference?

There are certain people who do their best work when under the pressure of a boss. They want to be told
exactly what is expected of them and they want to be held accountable for their work.

Others will perform their best when they feel appreciated and empowered. They want to be given the
tools they need to succeed and they want to be recognized for their work.

## What motivates your team?

The best way to motivate your team is to understand what motivates them.

Most people are motivated by having a sense of accomplishment and feeling like they are
making a difference. They want to feel like they are contributing to the success of the
company and that their work is valued.

A sense of accomplishment and feeling appreciated for their work is a great motivator for most people.

## Comparing the two styles

A boss may tell the sales team, "Make sure to say "xxx" when you are talking to a customer.

A leader may say, "We have found that customers respond well when we say "xxx".

A boss may say, "You need to get this done by Friday."

A leader may say, "We need to get this done by Friday. What do you need from me to make that happen?"

A leader will acknowledge their best performers and may have several different ways of doing so.
Multiple success targets enabling more people to get recognition. This creates a more positive
competitive environment. These little "gold star" moments are a great way to keep people motivated.

## Balancing the two styles

When employees are failing to meet basic metrics, that's when you may need to be more of a boss. You
have to set expectations and hold people accountable.

When employees are meeting their basic metrics, that's when you can be more of a leader. You can
empower them to do their best work and give them the tools they need to succeed.

This creates a very rewarding environment for performers and more disciplined environment for those
who are struggling. When employees are performing well, you do not want to create a negative pressure
on them. You want to keep them motivated and engaged. Acknowledgement of their success is a great
way to do that.
