# Hidden Customer Acquisition Costs

## The Problem
Calculating customer acquisition costs is primary a calculation
of the cost of marketing and sales.  However, there are other costs
that are frequently overlooked.

## The Cost of Losing Customers
When you lose a customer, you lose more than the revenue from that
customer.  You lose the existing, and potential customers that this 
person would have referred to you.

If losing a customer means losing 10 potential customers, then the
higher cost of customer acquisition is 10x the revenue from that
customer.

## Smart Customer Service
The best way to reduce customer acquisition costs is to reduce the
number of customers you lose.  The best way to do that is to provide
great customer service.  Sometimes that means giving the customer
more than they paid for.  It's more than worth it when you factor in
the high costs of losing multiple customers and potential customers.
