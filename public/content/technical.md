My passion for learning and teaching computer science gives
me the strong desire to share my knowledge with others. 

My technical skills give me an edge as a technological leader.  I
stay true to my roots as a software engineer by keeping my skills
well honed.  I am a full stack developer with a strong background in
operating systems and programming languages.
