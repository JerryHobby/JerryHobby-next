## The Problem
Calculating customer acquisition costs is primary a calculation
of the cost of marketing and sales.  However, there are other costs
that are frequently overlooked.

## The Cost of Losing Customers
When you lose a customer, you lose more than the revenue from that
customer.  You lose the existing, and potential customers that this
person would have referred to you.

If losing a customer means losing 10 potential customers, then the
higher cost of customer acquisition is 10x the revenue from that
customer.

## Smart Customer Service
The best way to reduce customer acquisition costs is to reduce the
number of customers you lose.  The best way to do that is to provide
great customer service.  Sometimes that means giving the customer
more than they paid for.  It\'s more than worth it when you factor in
the high costs of losing multiple customers and potential customers.

Management styles vary depending on the company culture, the leadership personalities, and the nature
of the work.  Some companies are very hierarchical and have a very top-down management style.  Other
companies are very flat and have a very collaborative management style.

When it comes to managing a team, there are two main styles: leadership and bossing.  Both styles
have their place, but one is more effective than the other.  The question is, which one are you?

## What is a leader?
A leader is someone who inspires others and gives them the tools they need to succeed.  A leader
recognizes that their team needs to be motivated and empowered to do their best work.

## What is a boss?
A boss is someone who tells others what to do and expects them to do it. Expectations are set and
the boss expects the team to meet them.  A boss motivates their team through the threat of disciplinary
action.

## What is the difference?
There are certain people who do their best work when under the pressure of a boss. They want to be told
exactly what is expected of them and they want to be held accountable for their work.

Others will perform their best when they feel appreciated and empowered.  They want to be given the
tools they need to succeed and they want to be recognized for their work.

## What motivates your team?
The best way to motivate your team is to understand what motivates them.

Most people are motivated by having a sense of accomplishment and feeling like they are
making a difference.  They want to feel like they are contributing to the success of the
company and that their work is valued.

A sense of accomplishment and feeling appreciated for their work is a great motivator for most people.

## Comparing the two styles

A boss may tell the sales team, "Make sure to say "xxx" when you are talking to a customer.

A leader may say, "We have found that customers respond well when we say "xxx".

A boss may say, "You need to get this done by Friday."

A leader may say, "We need to get this done by Friday.  What do you need from me to make that happen?"

A leader will acknowledge their best performers and may have several different ways of doing so.
Multiple success targets enabling more people to get recognition.  This creates a more positive
competitive environment.  These little "gold star" moments are a great way to keep people motivated.

## Balancing the two styles

When employees are failing to meet basic metrics, that\'s when you may need to be more of a boss.  You
have to set expectations and hold people accountable.

When employees are meeting their basic metrics, that\'s when you can be more of a leader.  You can
empower them to do their best work and give them the tools they need to succeed.

This creates a very rewarding environment for performers and more disciplined environment for those
who are struggling. When employees are performing well, you do not want to create a negative pressure
on them.  You want to keep them motivated and engaged.  Acknowledgement of their success is a great
way to do that.

', '# Zero Origin Numbers

## Introduction

One of the topics new programmers often struggle with is the concept of zero origin numbers.
This is a fancy way of saying that the first item in a list is item 0, not item 1.
This is a concept that is used in many programming languages, and it is important to understand it.

## Why Zero Origin Numbers?

There are two basic concepts to how things are numbered.  When counting items, if there is nothing
at all, that\'s zero.  If there is one item, that\'s one.  If there are two items, that\'s two.  And so on.

Counting is all about "how many".

The other concept is about location.  Where on the list is the first item?  This is called the index.
You could also say the offset.  The first item on the list is at offset 0.  Meaning that it is in the
very first position, so offset is zero.  The second item is at offset 1.  The third item is at offset 2.

The offset is all about "where".

Computers look at data as being stored at a particular location in memory.  Then they add the offset to
find the specific element you need.  So if you want the first item, you add 0 to the location of the list
because the first item is at the original memory location.  The second item is next in line, so you have
to read the next space in memory.  That\'s the data address plus 1. The location of the data plus 1 position
further.  The address plus the offset gives you the exact element you are looking for.

How many positions past the beginning? The first element is at the beginning, so the offset is zero.  The
second element is one position past the beginning, so the offset is one.

## Why is this important?

When you are working with lists, you need to know where the items are.  If you want to get the first item,
you need to know that it is at offset 0.  If you want to get the second item, you need to know that it is
at offset 1.

When you create a list of items with ten items, there are ten items in the list.  But the last item is at
offset 9.  The first item is at offset 0.  The second item is at offset 1.  The third item is at offset 2.

## The key distinction

The key distinction is that when you are counting items, you start at 1.  When you are looking for the
location of an item, you start at 0.

Humans like to think of "it\'s in the first position".  But computers like to think of "it\'s in the zeroth
position".  This is a very important distinction to understand.

The count is how many.  the index, or offset, is where.

## Examples

Let\'s look at some examples.  Let\'s say you have a list of items.  The list has 10 items in it.  The first
item is at offset 0.  The last item is at offset 9.  The count of items is 10.  The count is how many.  The
offset is where it is stored on the list.

Here\'s a common example.

```my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]```

How many items are on this list?  The answer is 10.  The count is 10.  The count is how many.

Where are they stored?  In my_list - at offsets 0 through 9.  That is the index, or offset.  The offset is
where.

Once you get the hang of offsets, it\'s easy.  Just don\'t confuse the count with the offset

## Conclusion

A common mistake is for new programmers to look in position 10 for tenth item on the list.  But the tenth
really 9 positions past the first element.  So you need to look in position 9.  The tenth item is at offset 9
because the first item is at offset 0.

Count = 10;
Offset = 9;

When you say things like "Computers count from 0", that\'s not really true.  Computers count from 1.  But
offsets start at 0 because offsets are added to the base position.  The first item is at the base position,
so  you add 0 to the base position to get the first item.  The second item is one position past the base
so you add 1.

The count is how many.  The offset is "how far from the base", otherwise, the index position.

Code comments are often an overlooked aspect of programming, but they play a vital role in software development. Here\'s why they are important:
```
"Code is like humor. When you have to
explain it, it\'s not funny." - Cory House
```
1. **Documentation:** Comments serve as documentation for your code. They explain the purpose of functions, variables, and sections of code. This is incredibly helpful for both yourself and other developers who may work on the same codebase.

2. **Clarity:** Well-commented code is easier to read and understand. It provides context and explanations for complex algorithms or tricky logic, making it accessible to everyone who reviews the code.

3. **Maintenance:** Code is not static; it evolves over time. When you revisit your code months or years later, comments act as reminders of what each part does, making updates and maintenance much smoother.

4. **Collaboration:** In a team environment, code comments facilitate collaboration. They enable team members to understand your code quickly, which is especially valuable when working on large projects.

5. **Debugging:** When debugging, comments can help you pinpoint the source of issues. By adding comments to your code, you can isolate problematic sections and streamline the debugging process.

In summary, code comments are an essential part of professional programming. They enhance code readability, aid in collaboration, and make maintenance and debugging more efficient.', 'cloeq3vrb0000r03jx0mf7ke5', 2, null, null, 1);

These tools require you to write code just to test other code that you have, or will, write for you application.
', '# Application Code Testing

## What is application code testing?
All popular programming tools support automated testing.  These tools require you to write code just to test other code that you have, or will, write for you application.

This sounds like an excessive amount of work as it requires a lot of extra code that does nothing but check other code for bugs.  Nobody wants to spend that much time writing code that doesn’t actually reduce the costs of developing software.

## How code testing works?
The method every programmer uses is to test their code as the develop it.  When they write a function that adds numbers together, they quickly examine the routine and maybe put some print statements in there to confirm the desired results.

This method works very well for scenarios that are really easy to understand. If a user supplies two numbers, it adds them together and returns the result.

But what if the user supplies an empty value or a non-numeric value?  These unexpected parameters cause problems.  If the programmer did not think of these particular exceptions, then the code could fail.

This “as you go” testing method is not always complete and may not factor in every potential scenario.

## Code Testing Frameworks
Code testing frameworks allow you to create code that calls your function with a wide variety of parameters just to see if it handles everything correctly.

When you run those tests, it tests every function in the application to make sure it does exactly what it’s supposed to do.  Then at every release, all tests can be run against the entire application to make sure nothing was broken.

That way, even if the code used to work, if new problems get introduced, they are caught before they cause application failures.

## My Biggest Coding Bug Ever
One of the applications I developed years ago had a component that took data from a report, extracted it, and charged the customer based on what was on the provided invoice.

The challenge of this particular application is that it had to scan the document and find the items and prices to invoice.  We had code that did this before, so not so tough.

The problem came about when they generated the documents, they had a small problem with the format of the document.  For example:
```
Item 1: 1234.00
```
That was what my code was looking for.  That’s what previous software was also looking for.  It’s computer generated, so it’s a reliable format and should work 100% of the time.

But when they wrote their documents, they inadvertently changed it by eliminating the space between the : and the number.  So my application would skip the first number and extract the rest.  I captured 234.00.

Technically the bug was on their end.  But the point is, I never caught that mistake.  My code went into production and it costs the company a huge amount of lost revenue.  Potentially in the millions of dollars over time.

When I developed my code, the tests worked because I was relying on the documented formats.  My testing was good.  But never went back and retested everything.

## Use Code Testing Frameworks
Had I used a proper testing framework, then I would have rerun all the tests whenever anything changed in the application.  From end-to-end. Every single component would be evaluated by the testing code.  While it worked fine when the code was written, it would break when the other component was introduced.  That would have been caught.

It is virtually impossible to test every component of an application without using comprehensive testing programs like this.  Thousands of small scripts that verify all the details of the code every time anything changes.

Yes, it costs more up-front.  But it saves a fortune trying to find and fix problems after the code goes into production.

Testing frameworks won’t catch everything, however, they will catch all the most important things such as calculations, data manipulation, etc.  There are even testing frameworks that control what the screen looks like at any given time so they can flag errors that affect the appearance of the app.

## Conclusion
Code testing frameworks and methodologies will save you money in the long run by creating a far more reliable product.  This saves you from issue like my example above, but also in the reporting, tracking, and fixing of other errors after release.  Not to mention the customer confidence impact of releasing buggy code into production.

There are many programming languages.  They pretty much all do the same thing,
but they have different syntax.  Each languange promises to solve a different
problem, but they all solve the same problem.

The biggest differentiator
between language is not the language itself, but the libraries that are
available for that language.  The libraries are what make the language useful.

Apple likes to say that Swift is the fastest growing programming language.  Google
promotes Go as the fastest growing programming language.  Android developers use
Java and Kotlin.  Web developers use JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, and C#.

All languages perform the same basic operations.  They all have variables, loops,
conditionals, functions, and classes.  They all have the same basic data types:
numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.  They all have the same basic
operators: +, -, *, /, %, =, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, !, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.

Choosing a language to learn is more about choosing what platform you want to code
for and what libraries you want to use.  If you want to code for iOS, you\'ll need
to learn Swift.  If you want to code for Android, you\'ll need to learn Java or
Kotlin.  If you want to code for the web, you\'ll need to learn JavaScript, Python,
Ruby, PHP, or C#.  If you want to code for Windows, you\'ll need to learn C#.

Just for fun, here\'s the list of string variable definitions in various programming languages.
They all do the same thing, but they all look different due to the syntax of the language:

1. **Python:**
   ```python
   myString = "Hello World"
   ```

2. **JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   var myString = "Hello World";
   ```

3. **Java:**
   ```java
   String myString = "Hello World";
   ```

4. **C#:**
   ```csharp
   string myString = "Hello World";
   ```

5. **C++:**
   ```cpp
   std::string myString = "Hello World";
   ```

6. **Ruby:**
   ```ruby
   myString = "Hello World"
   ```

7. **PHP:**
   ```php
   $myString = "Hello World";
   ```

8. **Swift:**
   ```swift
   var myString = "Hello World"
   ```

9. **Kotlin:**
   ```kotlin
   val myString = "Hello World"
   ```

10. **Go:**
    ```go
    var myString string = "Hello World"
    ```

11. **Rust:**
    ```rust
    let myString = "Hello World";
    ```

12. **TypeScript:**
    ```typescript
    let myString: string = "Hello World";
    ```

', '# The Myth of Artificial Intelligence

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has often been heralded as a game-changer, a magical force capable of revolutionizing industries and transforming the way we work and live. While AI has indeed made significant strides, it\'s essential to debunk some of the myths surrounding it, acknowledge the challenges, and maintain a positive perspective as we navigate the exciting but complex world of AI.

## The Myth of Instant Perfection

One of the most pervasive myths about AI is the expectation of instant perfection. We often envision AI systems seamlessly taking over tasks and processes, with human-like precision. However, the reality is that AI, including advanced language models like ChatGPT, is continually evolving. While it has made impressive strides in understanding and generating human-like text, it\'s not infallible. Plagiarism concerns are one such example.

## Plagiarism Concerns: A Reality Check

AI tools, including ChatGPT, are powerful aids for generating content and providing information. However, they are not immune to misuse. One significant concern is the potential for plagiarism when individuals use AI-generated content without proper attribution or manipulation of existing content. While AI can assist in content creation, ethical responsibility rests with the user to ensure originality and transparency. As we embrace AI, it\'s crucial to uphold ethical standards and acknowledge the role of human oversight in content creation.

## Navigating Implementation Challenges

Businesses are increasingly looking to AI for solutions that can streamline operations, improve customer experiences, and drive innovation. However, the implementation of AI for various business applications can be challenging. Each use case requires careful consideration, data preparation, and customization. AI is a tool that can enhance processes and decision-making, but it\'s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Businesses must invest in talent and infrastructure to harness AI\'s full potential.

## The Positive Outlook

Despite the challenges and misconceptions, the future of AI is exceptionally promising. AI is continually advancing, becoming more accessible, and opening doors to new possibilities. Tools like ChatGPT are already providing valuable assistance in content generation, customer support, and research. However, it\'s essential to approach AI with a realistic mindset. It\'s a tool to augment human capabilities, not a replacement.

## The Road Ahead

As we journey into the future of AI, we should embrace the potential while acknowledging the current limitations. Tools like ChatGPT are incredibly valuable but require ongoing refinement. Plagiarism concerns remind us of the importance of ethical AI usage, while the challenges in implementing AI for various business applications encourage us to be diligent in our endeavors.

In conclusion, the myth of AI as an all-knowing, perfect entity is just that—a myth. It\'s a powerful tool that, when used responsibly, can bring about significant positive change. Plagiarism concerns and implementation challenges are part of the learning curve. By embracing AI\'s potential while acknowledging its current state, we can navigate the evolving landscape with optimism and ensure that AI contributes to a brighter, more innovative future. It\'s a journey worth taking, one step at a time.', 'cloeq3vrb0000r03jx0mf7ke5', 3, null, null, 1);
